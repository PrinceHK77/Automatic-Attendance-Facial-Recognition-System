## 📸 How It Works

🔹 Face Registration  
Users capture and register their face images through a webcam interface.

🔹 Encoding  
Facial features are extracted and stored using embeddings for fast comparison.

🔹 Real-Time Detection  
Live camera feed compares real-time faces against the stored dataset.

🔹 Attendance Logging  
If a match is found, the system logs the name and timestamp into a CSV/DB file.
